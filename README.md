# GalaxyS-Nethunter
A custom port of kali nethunter to the Samsung Galaxy S I9000

# Why this device ? Isn't it really old ?
Yes this device is old but it still is a great little phone,has a active development community,decent specs and they can be purchased of eBay for realivly cheap (I got mine for £10 + £3 Delivery)

# Is this a ROM or Flashable File  ?
I will start devloping a ROM using cyanogenmod to bring the device to a more recent version of Android rather than 2.3 (Gingerbread) and a full ROM will help minimize issues as it will have everything setup and with the right dependinces installed by default. I play to release a flashable version of the Nethunter parts only for those that want to  merge it with the current ROM.

# Branches
The ROM Files will be split into different branches relevenat to each every for Example :

Master -  Information And Apps

Note Cyanogenmod Has Stopped Being Updated The Latest Version Of The Rom Using Cyanogenmod Will Be The Last On Before The Switch To LineageOS

~~CM-10-WIP - Cyangongenmod Based ROM (Android 4.3 Jelly Bean) Experimental/BETA~~

~~CM-10-RELEASE - Stable Cyanogenmod ROM Working with most features added~~

# Plans
Get a second phone to speed up development.

Write custom kernel version for preformace and enabling features such as HID and Ethernet gadgets.

Remove unnessary Android libarys and files to minimize secuirty issuses (Such as stagefright) and improve preformace or write replacements.

Get HID working
